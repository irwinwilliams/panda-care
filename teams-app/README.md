### Description

PandaCare is new way for providers in day care to manage information about the children they take care of and communicate seamlessly with parents.

PandaCare uses 
* Tabs to help administrators manage day care information
* Bots to communicate between parents and the day care and vice versa
* Proactive notifications for realtime updates (with AdaptiveCards)
* ChatGPT to make reasoning about how the children play and eat easier
* PowerBI for data presentation
* Microsoft Graph for calendar integration
* SQL Server for storage along with ef-migrations

It was certainly fun bringing together all those areas to attempt to solve a real-world challenge that we believe can be valuable for the stakeholders concerned.

# How to run
Using the teamsapp.local.yml as a guide, press F5 to run most of the applications. One project needs to be run separately in the panda-gpt-api directory.
Once there, "npm run start" will get it up and running.
Cheers!
